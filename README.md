# End-to-End-Bike-Price-Model
A Machine Learning regression model to predict used motorcycle prices using the BIKE DETAILS dataset from Kaggle.
This project develops a Machine Learning solution to bridge this gap. By leveraging the BIKE DETAILS dataset, the model identifies the key features—such as engine displacement, age, and mileage—that most significantly impact a vehicle's price. This provides a transparent, objective tool for fair pricing, helping users make informed financial decisions.
